# NMSU Pandas/Python 2018 Workshop
### This will be the standing repository for the 2018 RISE-STARTUP sponsored workshop I taught in May, 2018. All resources can be found within the repo or the links here in the README file. 

To create this workshop I remixed an excellent [kaggle tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/residentmario/indexing-selecting-assigning).

If you are brand new to python or jupyter notebook, I highly recommend installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) to ensure that both work together properly.  This tutorial was created with python 3.6.

The data for this notebook is the pollutants.csv file that can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/sohier/mussel-watch/data). Be sure to get the ***pollutants.csv*** file- look on the sidebar for the download. 

Once you download the data, store it in a folder together with all of the files in this repository (you must unzip the data first- the items need to be naked in the folder together).
