# NMSU Pandas/Python 2018 Workshop
### This will be the standing repository for the 2018 RISE-STARTUP sponsored workshop I taught in May, 2018. All resources can be found within the repo or the links here in the README file. 

To create this workshop I remixed an excellent [kaggle tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/residentmario/indexing-selecting-assigning).

If you are brand new to python or jupyter notebook, I highly recommend installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) to ensure that both work together properly.  This tutorial was created with python 3.6.

The data for this notebook is the pollutants.csv file that can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/sohier/mussel-watch/data). Be sure to get the ***pollutants.csv*** file- look on the sidebar for the download. 

Once you download the data, store it in a folder together with all of the files in this repository (you must unzip the data first- the items need to be naked in the folder together).

Open Jupyter Notebook, navigate to your files and open the learnPandasReference.ipynb file.  To run the code inside of each cell, click on the cell to highlight it and press shift + enter.

Work through the files in this order: 

1. LearnPandasReference
2. LearnPandas
3. LearnPandasAnswers

Have fun!
