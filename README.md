# NMSU Pandas/Python 2018 Workshop
### This will be the standing repository for the 2018 RISE-STARTUP sponsored workshop I taught in May, 2018. All resources can be found within the repo or the links here in the README file. 

To create this workshop I remixed an excellent [kaggle tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/residentmario/indexing-selecting-assigning).

The data for this notebook is the pollutants.csv file that can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/sohier/mussel-watch/data). Be sure to get the ***pollutants.csv*** file- look on the sidebar for the download.
